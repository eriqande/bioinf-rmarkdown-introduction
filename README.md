Introduction to Rmarkdown Exercise
================

This repository holds materials for the first course assignment. We
simply want you to introduce yourselves and your research interests to
us, while at the same time learning how to write things using Rmarkdown
and then knitting that document to different formats.

The file `about-me.Rmd` provides a skeleton to follow. You should just
edit that file, modifying it to include your own information in it.
There are certain goals in each section (like using numbered lists, or
writing code in fenced code blocks) as listed in each section.

The file `about-me-example.Rmd` gives some information about Eric, and
shows an example of what your response could look like. You can study it
to learn about Rmarkdown syntax. We have included three different
RMarkdown outputs of that file to see what they look like:

1.  about-me-example.html
2.  about-me-example.pdf
3.  about-me-example.docx

To learn more about RMarkdown, as part of this assigment, you are also
expected to download RStudio’s [RMarkdown Cheat
Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
and study it carefully. If you are completely new to RMarkdown, some of
it might be mysterious, but keep coming back to these sorts of RStudio
cheat sheets. I learn something new every time I read them.

Try knitting your document to all three formats found in the YAML header
(HTML, PDF, Word). Note that to get the PDF version done right, you
probably have to add an image which is your original JPG, but converted
to a PDF. (i.e. like `images/eric.pdf`). This can be done

**Super Bonus Points:** If you really want to impress us, try adding a
few things that we have suggested in the template to your own document.
You can find lots of things you might try in the RMarkdown cheat sheet.
For example:

  - Make a markdown table of something,
  - Play with different text formatting,
  - Try also rendering your document to a Slidy presentation. (But note
    that you may wish to rename the document so doing this does not
    overwrite your plain old `about-me.html` file.)
